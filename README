My dotfiles for ZSH and various other programs. If you like colours, or
pimped out prompts, or other time wasters, look elsewhere.

@@BLAHBLAH@@ will very likely need alteration to something suitable.

I use ZSH on my "desktop" systems, and largely do not care what any of
the thousands of other systems and user accounts I have to deal with set
for their shell or their shell configuration. Though I might go as far
as `exec zsh` or the like if the default shell is too annoying, or
disable colours so that I can actually read the text. In my younger
days, I dabbled with a shell configuration that would support both bash
and zsh, but that's thankless extra work, so meh.
